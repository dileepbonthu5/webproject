WEB AND DATABASE PROGRAMMING-PROJECT

INTRODUCTION: My project is about a e-commerce website that user can register ,login  and add the games in to cart and purchase the games with their respective prices I.e; each game is different genre like action games ,wrestling games  and athletics ..etc with different prices.The reason for the project is in my childhood I used to play virtual games and I interested in gaming sector.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: To develop this project, I have used various technologies like HTML, CSS, MySQL, Javascript. Each technology has its own importance and major contribution to the project. Html is used in creating webpages, css is used in styling, while Java script and Node.js are used for interactive programming and real time run environment respectively.

INSTALLATIONS: I installed the GIT HUB and I commit the changes in it. I installed NODEMON, MYSQL for this website. MYSQL we can create tables in the database. This database stores the details of the games and other entities like users, cart and payments. The database has all the data of the website.

ENTITIES: We have different entities like buyer(user), orders, games, payments. Every entity is interlinked with each other yet has their unique ID like Buyer Id, Order ID etc., These has their own attributes which has information about each entity 

ISSUES: The minor issues occurred in this website I.e; the customer cannot enter their personal details and they’re not enter their card details.Some changes need to be done and some technologies need to be added for making better website.At present the coding is done but not able to login and connected to data base and couldn’t add my games in to cart for the further payment.

Modification required: Upto now, only few features are added like images only. In future I would like to add better visuals effects and more user friendly options like trail games for some time and then if they like it they would pay it.
