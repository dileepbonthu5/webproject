WEB AND DATABASE PROGRAMMING-PROJECT

INTRODUCTION: My project is about a e-commerce website that user can register ,login  and add the games in to cart and purchase the games with their respective prices I.e; each game is different genre like action games ,wrestling games  and athletics ..etc with different prices.The reason for the project is in my childhood I used to play virtual games and I interested in gaming sector.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: To develop this website i  used the technologies like HTML for creating pages, SQL is used for creating and using database, CSS is for styling the webpages. JAVASCRIPT to create dynamic content. Node.js is for creating real time run environment.

INSTALLATIONS: I installed the GIT HUB and I commit the changes in it. I installed NODEMON, MYSQL for this website. MYSQL we can create tables in the database. This database stores the details of the users like their first name, last-name, email and passwords.

ENTITIES: We have different entities like buyer(user), orders, games, payments. Every entity is interlinked with each other yet has their unique ID like Buyer Id, Order ID etc., These has their own attributes which has information about each entity 

ISSUES: The minor issues occurred in this website I.e; the customer cannot enter their personal details and they’re not enter their card details.Some changes need to be done and some technologies need to be added for making better website.At present the coding is done but not able to login and connected to data base and couldn’t add my games in to cart for the further payment.

EVOLVEMENTS: As of now, the project need a few modifications regarding the cart and payment. It needs to be updated with more security for users around the globe. Also we need to add more games and features regarding payment.
